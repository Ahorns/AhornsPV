<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master’s student in Integrated Circuit Design at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhang Wei](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-zhang-eeweiz) of [Reconfigurable Computing Systems Lab](https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/#) in HKUST. 

My research interest includes Design Automation, Machine Learning and advanced Algorithm for Placement and Routing. 

You'll find my curriculum vitae uploaded here: [Song Menglin's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Song Menglin CV.pdf).
